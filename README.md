## Abstract

The aim of this project is to create and train an artificial intelligence model using supervised learning. The purpose is to analyze hyperlinks to detect whether they are potential attack vectors related to phishing attempts. These attacks persuade victims to trust fake entities and navigate to malicious websites created to harvest sensitive data.

## Methodology

### Data

The model will be trained using publicly available labeled datasets containing hyperlinks in text form, along with information about them. The data will be analyzed and processed accordingly before being fed into the model.

### Tools and Libraries

The following tools and libraries will be used:

- **TensorFlow:** For building and training neural network models.
- **Scikit-learn:** For implementing classical machine learning algorithms.
- **Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib:** For data analysis and visualization.

### Implementation

Various neural network architectures and machine learning algorithms will be tested to solve the binary classification problem. The data will be prepared and cleaned using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Numpy libraries. The potential models will be implemented using TensorFlow for neural networks and Scikit-learn for classical classification algorithms.

### Visualization

The Matplotlib library will enable graphical visualization of the results obtained and the process of learning the models.

## Output

The final product will be a model (function) that takes a hyperlink as input and returns the probability of the link being potentially dangerous. The model with the best result obtained during testing will be selected.

## Supervision

**Scientific Supervisor:** Dr hab. inż. Marek Natkaniec
